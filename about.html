    <p>Hi! My name is Andrea Klvackova, but most people know me as Zabka. I originally come from Slovakia, but past few years I'm living in Prague with my small dog Jakub. I am currently painting on sneakers, clothes, etc. and creating custom pieces, always just one original piece! The idea about creating customs came from my mom, who gave me my first colors for textile as a gift. I've been playing around with it ever since and I also painted some canvas shoes, that got great feedback. So I painted more, tested them out and next thing I know, my friend asked me, if I can paint her some shoes. It were a Vans Slip-Ons and shortly after I was approached by Vans to paint sneakers for benefitial event Vans Classic and Prague.<br><br>
Overall I've been painting custom sneakers for over three years and it's been a trend for a past couple of years. You can always tell if person wants to do something creative or just saw something on Instagram. I am always supporting original and unique ideas! My custom sneakers can handle a lot. You can wear them outside in whatever weather, you can even swim in them.They are painted using very high end colors, so don't think they are just for posing, you can do whatever you want and I encourage you to do so!
</p>

        <p>My motto is “Doing what you love is the most important thing in life.” And that’s what drives me in my art and life as well. I want to create art that is dynamic, that is in the streets, on the people, moving with your every step. Is there anything that expresses dynamic part of my art better than shoes? I also would like to motivate and inspire people, not necessarily to start painting the sneakers, but follow their passion in life. It took a lot of effort until I could say, that I am making living out of art, but every step of the way was worth it.</p>
